### What Zach Enjoyed In This Project
> I really enjoyed fiddling with this API because it made me feel like I was actually manipulating data even if it was at the most basic level. I feel like I also learned better usage of dictionaries from this.
> I also really enjoyed actually making a website that has a functionality to it. It's something that I'd actually come back and use for whenever I want to find food in another city.
### What Zach Didn't Enjoy
> Forcing myself to fit a login system into this project didn't make sense. I only did it to fit the rubric, when in reality this website would function just fine without it. Personally, I'd remove it.
> I don't like working with databases either. I don't see a use for the database here as well other than for keeping track of the login system. Overall, I'd remove both these features.
### What Clayton Enjoyed In This Project
> I enjoyed working with someone else who was more easily able to help me figure out my code due to them also working on the same code rather than explain what is hapening and what does what every time i needed help
### What Clayton Didn't Enjoy In This Project
> html.
> i didnt really think that the data base was needed for our app and trying to figure it and the login out was very confusing and frusturating
## Technical Requirements
### [Fly.io!](https://fly.io/)
#### Learn how to launch an app here.
### Download our Git!
### [Get a Yelp API key!](https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app)
#### You need this in order to get our app to run for you.
### Place the Yelp API key and the Database URI inside of the .py file under the specified variables
## Additional Tidbits
### .Env doesn't work for whatever reason. Any variable taken from here makes the program crash, but otherwise, is fine. No clue why.
### You can edit the search parameters in our .py file to whatever city you like, and find restaurants there!
## Known Bugs
### Some restaurants will be unable to load properly, resulting in "Internal Server Error." This is due to some restaurants not having the appropriate variables we're asking form.
